> Prompt engineering structures what an LLM *sees*. **Canvas engineering** structures what a diffusion model *thinks in*. You declare which regions of latent space carry video, actions, proprioception, reward, or thought — their geometry, their temporal frequency, their connectivity, their loss participation — and the canvas compiles that declaration into attention masks, loss weights, and frame mappings. The layout is the schema. The topology is the compute graph. Together they form a **type system for multimodal latent computation**: the model doesn't discover what its internal state means — you declare it, and the structure constrains what it learns.

## The idea

Prompt engineering gives LLMs structured context — few-shot examples, system instructions, tool descriptions — so they produce better outputs. Canvas engineering does the same thing one level deeper: it gives diffusion models structured *latent space* so they learn better representations. A diffusion transformer's latent tensor is just a flat bag of positions. **canvas-engineering** turns it into a typed workspace by letting you declare:

- **What** each region means — `RegionSpec` with bounds, temporal frequency, loss weight, input/output role
- **How** regions interact — `CanvasTopology` as a directed graph of attention operations with temporal constraints
- **How fast** each region runs — `period` maps canvas timesteps to real-world frames, so a "thought" region at period=4 and a "perception" region at period=1 coexist on the same canvas

This is literally a type system. `region_indices()` is an offset calculation. `loss_weight_mask()` is type-directed codegen. The topology is a calling convention. Two agents with the same canvas schema can share latent state directly — no tokenization, no encoding — because the schema tells you what every position means.

The library has two orthogonal pieces, validated over [26 experiments and 236 training runs](https://github.com/JacobFV/recursive-omnimodal-video-action-model):

### 1. The canvas: structured multimodal latent space

Large video diffusion models (CogVideoX, Mochi, Wan) generate video. The **spatiotemporal canvas** extends them to *do things* — predict robot actions, estimate rewards, process proprioception — by placing heterogeneous modalities on a shared 3D grid with dedicated encoders and decoders. You design the schema, the model attends over everything.

### 2. Looped attention: weight-sharing regularization

**Looped attention** iterates transformer blocks multiple times with learned iteration embeddings. The empirical result: **1.73x parameter efficiency** over matched-depth models (p<0.001) through weight-sharing regularization (fixed-point convergence, cosine similarity 0.926 → 0.996). A frozen CogVideoX-2B backbone + **350K trainable loop parameters** outperforms **11.5M unfrozen parameters** on action prediction. 3 loops is optimal.

What looping is *not*: iterative reasoning -- at least not yet. Three independent experiments falsified that hypothesis (p=0.97, p>0.05, p>0.05). The benefit is regularization, not reasoning depth, not at the limited scale I tested anyway... tho I'm skeptical.

## Quick start

```bash
pip install canvas-engineering
```

### Graft looped attention onto CogVideoX-2B

```python
from canvas_engineering import graft_looped_blocks, CurriculumScheduler
from diffusers import CogVideoXTransformer3DModel
import torch

# Load pretrained video diffusion model
transformer = CogVideoXTransformer3DModel.from_pretrained(
    "THUDM/CogVideoX-2b", subfolder="transformer", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16
)

# Graft 3-loop attention onto all 30 frozen DiT blocks
looped_blocks, action_head = graft_looped_blocks(
    transformer,
    max_loops=3,       # 3 is optimal (empirically validated)
    freeze="full",     # freeze backbone, train only loop params
    action_dim=7,      # 6DOF end-effector + gripper
)

# Only 350K params to optimize
optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(
    [p for b in looped_blocks for p in b.parameters() if p.requires_grad]
    + list(action_head.parameters()),
    lr=1e-4,
)

# Curriculum: gradually ramp from 1 to 3 loops during training
scheduler = CurriculumScheduler(max_loops=3, total_steps=5000)
```

That's it. The frozen 1.69B-parameter backbone now loops its computation 3 times per forward pass, with learned iteration embeddings that cost 0.02% of the model.

## How looped attention works

<!-- Source: scripts/generate_diagrams.py :: generate_looped_attention() -->
<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JacobFV/canvas-engineering/main/assets/looped_attention.png" alt="Looped attention block diagram" width="75%"></p>

**Zero-init safety**: Loop embeddings start at zero. At initialization, the model behaves identically to the pretrained backbone. No distribution shift. Safe to graft onto any frozen model.

**Gradient checkpointing**: Multi-loop training fits in 40GB VRAM by recomputing activations on the backward pass (per-loop, not per-block).

## How the canvas works

A **canvas** is a 3D grid `(T, H, W)` where different regions handle different modalities. This is the omnimodal I/O layer — it's what lets a video model also predict actions, read proprioception, and estimate reward.

```python
from canvas_engineering import CanvasLayout, SpatiotemporalCanvas

# Robot manipulation canvas
layout = CanvasLayout(
    T=5, H=8, W=8, d_model=256,
    regions={
        "visual":  (0, 5, 0, 6, 0, 6),    # 180 positions — video patches
        "action":  (0, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1),    #   5 positions — per-frame actions
        "reward":  (2, 3, 7, 8, 0, 1),    #   1 position  — scalar reward
    },
    t_current=2,  # t >= 2 is future (diffusion output)
)

canvas = SpatiotemporalCanvas(layout)
batch = canvas.create_empty(batch_size=4)          # (4, 320, 256)
batch = canvas.place(batch, visual_embs, "visual") # write video patches
actions = canvas.extract(batch, "action")          # read action predictions
```

**Built-in examples** for robot manipulation, computer use agents, and multi-robot control:

```python
# Computer use agent: screen pixels + mouse + keyboard + LLM steering
layout = CanvasLayout(
    T=16, H=32, W=32, d_model=768,
    regions={
        "screen":   (0, 16, 0, 24, 0, 24),     # 9,216 positions (56%)
        "mouse":    (0, 16, 24, 26, 0, 4),      #   128 positions
        "keyboard": (0, 16, 26, 28, 0, 4),      #   128 positions
        "llm":      (0, 16, 28, 32, 0, 8),      #   512 positions
    },
)
# → 16,384 total positions, bandwidth-proportional allocation
```

## Why 3 loops?

From a 12-condition grid ablation on CogVideoX-2B with real Bridge V2 robot video (36 runs, $152 compute):

```
Action Loss (lower = better)
                Frozen         Half-frozen     Unfrozen
                (350K params)  (3.7M params)   (11.7M params)
  1 loop        0.121          0.115           0.108
  2 loops       0.140          0.119           0.112
  3 loops       0.073 ◀ BEST   0.107           0.088
  4 loops       0.104          0.137           0.124
```

**3 loops wins at every freeze level.** The frozen 3-loop condition (350K params) beats every unfrozen condition (11.5M+ params). 4 loops consistently regresses from 3.

Freeze level doesn't affect action loss at all (marginals: 0.109 vs 0.108, p=0.72). It only affects video generation quality (8-9x gap on diffusion loss).

## Declarative region frequency

Canvas regions can operate at different real-world frequencies. A `RegionSpec` declares per-region semantics — temporal frequency, loss participation, and loss weight — as first-class properties.

```python
from canvas_engineering import CanvasLayout, RegionSpec

layout = CanvasLayout(
    T=16, H=32, W=32, d_model=768,
    regions={
        "screen": (0, 16, 0, 24, 0, 24),         # raw tuple — period=1 default

        "mouse": RegionSpec(
            bounds=(0, 16, 24, 26, 0, 4),
            period=1, loss_weight=2.0,             # high-freq, emphasize accuracy
        ),
        "thought": RegionSpec(
            bounds=(0, 4, 28, 32, 0, 8),
            period=4, loss_weight=1.0,             # low-freq: 4 slots → frames 0,4,8,12
        ),
        "task_prompt": RegionSpec(
            bounds=(0, 1, 26, 28, 0, 4),
            is_output=False,                       # input-only conditioning, no loss
        ),
    },
)

# Per-position loss weighting — respects is_output and loss_weight
weights = layout.loss_weight_mask("cuda")          # (N,) tensor
loss = (per_position_loss * weights).sum() / weights.sum()

# Frame mapping between canvas time and real-world time
layout.real_frame("thought", canvas_t=2)           # → 8
layout.canvas_frame("thought", real_t=8)           # → 2
layout.canvas_frame("thought", real_t=7)           # → None (not aligned)
```

Raw tuples auto-wrap as `RegionSpec(bounds=tuple)` with defaults — full backward compatibility. All existing code continues to work unchanged.

**RegionSpec fields:**

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `bounds` | *(required)* | `(t0, t1, h0, h1, w0, w1)` spatial-temporal extent |
| `period` | `1` | Canvas frames per real-world update (1 = every frame) |
| `is_output` | `True` | Whether this region participates in diffusion loss |
| `loss_weight` | `1.0` | Relative loss weight for positions in this region |

## Non-Euclidean connectivity

Canvas regions don't have to interact via Euclidean adjacency. A `CanvasTopology` declaratively specifies which **block-to-block attention operations** are performed per step. Each `Connection` is a discrete cross-attention op: `src` tokens query against `dst` keys/values.

```python
from canvas_engineering import Connection, CanvasTopology

# Declarative: define the full attention compute DAG as data
topology = CanvasTopology(connections=[
    # Self-attention within each region
    Connection(src="robot1_cam",    dst="robot1_cam"),
    Connection(src="robot1_action", dst="robot1_action"),
    Connection(src="robot2_cam",    dst="robot2_cam"),
    Connection(src="robot2_action", dst="robot2_action"),
    Connection(src="shared_task",   dst="shared_task"),

    # Causal: each robot's camera informs its own actions
    Connection(src="robot1_action", dst="robot1_cam"),
    Connection(src="robot2_action", dst="robot2_cam"),

    # Coordination: robots see each other's cameras
    Connection(src="robot1_cam", dst="robot2_cam", weight=0.5),
    Connection(src="robot2_cam", dst="robot1_cam", weight=0.5),

    # Hub: shared task reads from cameras, actions read from task
    Connection(src="shared_task",   dst="robot1_cam"),
    Connection(src="shared_task",   dst="robot2_cam"),
    Connection(src="robot1_action", dst="shared_task"),
    Connection(src="robot2_action", dst="shared_task"),
])

# Generate attention mask or iterate over ops
mask = topology.to_attention_mask(layout)  # (N, N) float
ops = topology.attention_ops()             # [(src, dst, weight), ...]
```

**Convenience constructors** for common patterns:

```python
CanvasTopology.dense(["a", "b", "c"])          # fully connected (standard transformer)
CanvasTopology.isolated(["a", "b", "c"])       # block-diagonal (no cross-region)
CanvasTopology.hub_spoke("task", ["r1", "r2"]) # star topology
CanvasTopology.causal_chain(["obs", "plan", "act"])  # A → B → C
CanvasTopology.causal_temporal(["obs", "act"]) # same-frame self + prev-frame cross
```

<!-- Source: scripts/generate_topology_diagrams.py :: generate_all() -->
<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JacobFV/canvas-engineering/main/assets/topology_constructors.png" alt="Topology convenience constructors" width="100%"></p>

The topology is the compute graph of attention operations — not a soft mask on dense attention. Block self-attention is one special case. Dense is another. The interesting cases are structured DAGs that mirror the causal/information-flow structure of your problem.

### Temporal connectivity

Connections can constrain **which timesteps** participate in each attention op. By default, all timesteps see all timesteps (dense in time). With temporal offsets, you get causal chains over time, same-frame-only constraints, or sliding windows.

```python
# Default: all timesteps (backward compatible)
Connection(src="cam", dst="action")

# Same-frame only: no temporal leakage
Connection(src="cam", dst="action", t_src=0, t_dst=0)

# Previous frame cross-attention: action at t queries obs at t-1
Connection(src="action", dst="obs", t_src=0, t_dst=-1)

# Full temporal self-attention (explicit)
Connection(src="thought", dst="thought", t_src=None, t_dst=None)
```

**Semantics**: `t_src` and `t_dst` are relative offsets from a shared reference frame. The mask generator iterates over all reference frames and pairs positions at `ref + t_src` with positions at `ref + t_dst`. Out-of-bounds timesteps are silently skipped.

| `t_src` | `t_dst` | Behavior |
|---------|---------|----------|
| `None` | `None` | All src ↔ all dst (dense in time) |
| `0` | `0` | Same-frame only |
| `0` | `-1` | Src at current frame queries dst at previous frame |
| `None` | `0` | All src timesteps query dst at each reference frame |

The `causal_temporal` constructor gives you same-frame self-attention + previous-frame cross-attention for all regions — no future leakage, but full temporal context.

## Attention function types

Not all connections should use the same attention mechanism. A `Connection` can declare its `fn` — the type of function used for that edge. Regions can also set `default_attn` — a default for all outgoing connections. The schema declares *intent*; execution is backend-dependent.

```python
from canvas_engineering import CanvasLayout, RegionSpec, Connection, CanvasTopology

layout = CanvasLayout(
    T=8, H=16, W=16, d_model=512,
    regions={
        # Region defaults: what kind of attention makes sense for this modality?
        "visual":  RegionSpec(bounds=(0,8, 0,12, 0,12), default_attn="cross_attention"),
        "proprio": RegionSpec(bounds=(0,8, 12,13, 0,2), default_attn="linear_attention"),
        "thought": RegionSpec(bounds=(0,4, 13,15, 0,4), default_attn="mamba"),
        "goal":    RegionSpec(bounds=(0,1, 15,16, 0,4), default_attn="cross_attention",
                              is_output=False),
    },
)

topology = CanvasTopology(connections=[
    # Self-attention (uses each region's default_attn)
    Connection(src="visual",  dst="visual"),           # → cross_attention
    Connection(src="proprio", dst="proprio"),           # → linear_attention
    Connection(src="thought", dst="thought"),           # → mamba
    Connection(src="goal",    dst="goal"),              # → cross_attention

    # Cross-region with explicit fn overrides
    Connection(src="visual",  dst="goal", fn="gated"),       # optional conditioning
    Connection(src="thought", dst="visual", fn="perceiver"), # compress 864 visual tokens
    Connection(src="proprio", dst="visual", fn="pooling"),   # just need a summary
    Connection(src="thought", dst="thought", fn="copy",      # direct latent relay
               t_src=0, t_dst=-1),                           # from previous frame
])

# Resolve: returns (src, dst, weight, fn) with defaults applied
ops = topology.attention_ops(layout)
# [("visual", "visual", 1.0, "cross_attention"),
#  ("proprio", "proprio", 1.0, "linear_attention"),
#  ("thought", "thought", 1.0, "mamba"),
#  ...]
```

**Resolution order:** `connection.fn` (if set) → `region.default_attn` (if layout provided) → `"cross_attention"` (global default). Fully backward compatible — existing code without `fn` or `default_attn` resolves to standard cross-attention.

### The lineup

Every connection function type represents a different theory of how information should flow between regions. The schema declares intent; the executor decides implementation.

| Type | Family | Complexity | Best for |
|------|--------|-----------|----------|
| `cross_attention` | Dot-product | O(NM) | General-purpose, content-based selection |
| `linear_attention` | Dot-product | O(N+M) | Low-dimensional or high-frequency streams |
| `cosine_attention` | Dot-product | O(NM) | Stable gradients, no temperature scaling |
| `sigmoid_attention` | Dot-product | O(NM) | Non-exclusive / multi-label attention |
| `gated` | Gating | O(NM) | Optional conditioning (goals, instructions) |
| `perceiver` | Compression | O(NK) | Large dst regions compressed through bottleneck |
| `pooling` | Compression | O(N+M) | Scalar/low-dim conditioning signals |
| `copy` | Transfer | O(N) | Direct latent sharing, broadcast regions |
| `mamba` | State-space | O(N) | Long temporal sequences, causal connections |
| `rwkv` | State-space | O(N) | Temporal connections with learned decay |
| `hyena` | Convolution | O(N log N) | Sub-quadratic long-range via FFT |
| `sparse_attention` | Sparse | O(NK) | Selective binding to specific positions |
| `local_attention` | Sparse | O(NW) | Spatially local interactions (neighboring patches) |
| `none` | Meta | O(0) | Ablation — edge declared but disabled |
| `random_fixed` | Meta | O(NK) | Baseline — does learned structure matter? |
| `mixture` | Meta | O(NK) | MoE-style routing for multi-modal hubs |

### Design recipes

**Robot manipulation** — vision-heavy, low-latency actions:
```python
"visual":  default_attn="cross_attention"    # full attention for spatial reasoning
"proprio": default_attn="linear_attention"   # 12D joint state, no need for O(N²)
"action":  default_attn="cross_attention"    # content-based selection from visual
# visual → action: cross_attention (which visual patches matter for this action?)
# proprio → action: pooling (just need the joint state vector)
```

**Embodied agent with memory** — long-horizon, selective recall:
```python
"perception": default_attn="cross_attention"
"memory":     default_attn="mamba"            # O(N) sequential over long history
"policy":     default_attn="cross_attention"
# memory → perception: gated (decide whether to incorporate memory at all)
# perception → memory: perceiver (compress percepts into fixed-size memory)
```

**Multi-agent coordination** — shared latent space:
```python
"agent_a.thought": default_attn="rwkv"       # causal temporal within agent
"agent_b.thought": default_attn="rwkv"
"shared_task":     default_attn="cross_attention"
# agent_a.thought → shared_task: cross_attention (selective broadcast)
# shared_task → agent_b.thought: gated (selective incorporation)
# agent_a.thought → agent_b.thought: copy (direct latent relay)
```

**Vision transformer backbone** — drop-in structured attention:
```python
"cls_token":  default_attn="cross_attention"
"patches":    default_attn="local_attention"   # each patch attends locally
"readout":    default_attn="cross_attention"
# cls_token → patches: cross_attention (global aggregation)
# patches → patches: local_attention (spatial locality)
# readout → cls_token: pooling (single vector summary)
```

## Semantic types and transfer distance

Each canvas region represents a modality — RGB video, joint angles, reward, language. `RegionSpec` lets you declare the modality's **semantic type** as a human-readable string and a frozen embedding vector from a fixed model. This turns modality compatibility from a human judgment call into a computable quantity.

```python
from canvas_engineering import RegionSpec, transfer_distance

cam = RegionSpec(
    bounds=(0, 8, 0, 12, 0, 12),
    semantic_type="RGB video 224x224 30fps from front-facing monocular camera",
    semantic_embedding=embed("RGB video 224x224 30fps from front-facing monocular camera"),
    embedding_model="openai/text-embedding-3-small",  # fixed, declared
)

depth = RegionSpec(
    bounds=(0, 8, 0, 12, 0, 12),
    semantic_type="Metric depth map 224x224 from front-facing monocular camera",
    semantic_embedding=embed("Metric depth map 224x224 from front-facing monocular camera"),
)

joints = RegionSpec(
    bounds=(0, 8, 12, 13, 0, 1),
    semantic_type="7-DOF joint angles at 30Hz",
    semantic_embedding=embed("7-DOF joint angles at 30Hz"),
)

transfer_distance(cam, depth)    # ~0.15 — cheap to bridge (1-2 layers)
transfer_distance(cam, joints)   # ~0.65 — expensive (full MLP adapter)
```

<!-- Source: scripts/generate_semantic_diagrams.py :: generate_transfer_distance() -->
<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JacobFV/canvas-engineering/main/assets/transfer_distance.png" alt="Semantic embedding space with transfer distances" width="65%"></p>

**Why this matters:** If canvas schemas produce stable latent representations (an empirical hypothesis we're testing), then semantic embedding distance approximates the real cost of bridging two modalities — how many adapter layers, how much data. The embedding model must be fixed and declared so distances are comparable across time and projects.

## Canvas schemas

A `CanvasSchema` bundles layout + topology into a single portable, serializable object — the complete type signature for a canvas-based model.

```python
from canvas_engineering import CanvasSchema, CanvasLayout, RegionSpec, CanvasTopology, Connection

schema = CanvasSchema(
    layout=CanvasLayout(
        T=8, H=16, W=16, d_model=256,
        regions={
            "visual": RegionSpec(
                bounds=(0, 8, 0, 12, 0, 12),
                semantic_type="RGB video 224x224",
                semantic_embedding=(0.12, -0.05, ...),
            ),
            "action": RegionSpec(
                bounds=(0, 8, 12, 14, 0, 2),
                loss_weight=2.0,
                semantic_type="6-DOF end-effector + gripper",
                semantic_embedding=(0.31, 0.08, ...),
            ),
        },
    ),
    topology=CanvasTopology(connections=[
        Connection(src="visual", dst="visual"),
        Connection(src="action", dst="visual"),
        Connection(src="action", dst="action"),
    ]),
    metadata={"model": "CogVideoX-2B", "data": "bridge_v2"},
)

# Serialize — the schema is the complete declaration
schema.to_json("robot_v1.json")
loaded = CanvasSchema.from_json("robot_v1.json")

# Find compatible regions across two schemas
pairs = schema.compatible_regions(other_schema, threshold=0.3)
# → [("visual", "camera", 0.04), ("action", "gripper_cmd", 0.12)]
```

The schema file is human-readable JSON. It declares everything needed to interpret a canvas tensor: geometry, region semantics, connectivity, and modality types. Two models with the same schema can share latent state directly.

## Freeze strategies

| Strategy | What's frozen | Trainable | Action loss | Diffusion loss | Use when |
|----------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|----------|
| `"full"` | Everything except loops | 350K | 0.073 | 1.48 | Max efficiency, action-only tasks |
| `"half"` | Only `patch_embed` | 3.7M | 0.107 | 0.19 | Good video + good actions |
| `"none"` | Nothing | 11.7M | 0.088 | 0.18 | Full fine-tuning, compute available |

## Progressive sharpening

Loop-indexed inverse temperature for bridging the soft→sharp attention discontinuity:

```python
from canvas_engineering import SharpeningSchedule

schedule = SharpeningSchedule(max_loops=3, beta_min=1.0, beta_max=4.0)

# Loop 0: beta=1.0 (soft, broad gradients)
# Loop 1: beta=2.5 (medium)
# Loop 2: beta=4.0 (sharp, precise attention)
```

Early loops train Q/K matrices via gradient flow. Later loops exploit trained structure with near-discrete attention. Empirically: mild sharpening (beta→2) gives 1.30x F1 on contact detection; aggressive (beta→8) hurts.

## What looping is NOT

We tested three cortical-computation hypotheses rigorously. Two are **falsified**:

| Hypothesis | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Looping enables iterative reasoning | **Falsified** | 3 independent nulls (p=0.97, p>0.05, p>0.05) |
| Shared canvas creates multi-modal binding | **Falsified** | Joint prediction 19% worse (p<0.0001) |
| Token allocation follows power laws | Borderline | R^2=0.902 but alpha=0.011 (doubling tokens = 0.8%) |

The looping benefit is **weight-sharing regularization** (parameter efficiency, fixed-point convergence, lower variance), not iterative reasoning. The omnimodal capability comes from the **canvas architecture** (multi-encoder/multi-decoder), not from the looping.

## Compositional types and hierarchical coarse-graining

`compile_schema` accepts nested dataclasses, not just flat field lists. Every nested type automatically gets a **coarse-grained field** — a compressed representation at the child's path that bottlenecks cross-level attention. This means a parent with 1000 children doesn't create O(N²) cross-entity connections — interactions route through compact coarse-grained fields.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass, field as dc_field
from canvas_engineering import Field, compile_schema

@dataclass
class Sensor:
    __coarse__ = Field(2, 4)          # when viewed from parent: 2×4 region
    rgb: Field = Field(12, 12)
    depth: Field = Field(6, 6)
    lidar: Field = Field(4, 8)

@dataclass
class Arm:
    joints: Field = Field(1, 7)
    force_torque: Field = Field(1, 6)
    gripper: Field = Field(1, 2, loss_weight=2.0)

@dataclass
class SurgicalRobot:
    # Per-child coarse-grained size via metadata
    sensor: Sensor = dc_field(default_factory=Sensor)
    left_arm: Arm = dc_field(
        default_factory=Arm,
        metadata={"coarse": Field(2, 4)},  # override for this edge
    )
    right_arm: Arm = dc_field(default_factory=Arm)
    safety: Field = Field(2, 4, loss_weight=5.0)

bound = compile_schema(SurgicalRobot(), d_model=256)
```

The compiled schema has:
- `sensor` (2×4 coarse-grained field) ↔ `sensor.rgb`, `sensor.depth`, `sensor.lidar`
- `left_arm` (2×4 override) ↔ `left_arm.joints`, `left_arm.force_torque`, `left_arm.gripper`
- `right_arm` (1×1 default) ↔ its child fields
- `safety` connects to all coarse-grained fields (via parent-level intra connections)

Cross-level attention: `safety ↔ sensor (coarse) ↔ sensor.rgb`. The arms don't see each other's internal joint states — only through the parent's `safety` field and their own coarse-grained representations.

### Arrays: fleets, teams, portfolios

Arrays of entities each get their own coarse-grained field. The parent sees only the compact representations:

```python
@dataclass
class Vehicle:
    __coarse__ = Field(4, 4)          # each vehicle → 4×4 summary
    camera: Field = Field(8, 8)
    lidar: Field = Field(4, 8)
    plan: Field = Field(2, 4)
    action: Field = Field(1, 4, loss_weight=2.0)

@dataclass
class Fleet:
    dispatch: Field = Field(4, 4)
    vehicles: list = dc_field(default_factory=list)

fleet = Fleet(vehicles=[Vehicle() for _ in range(50)])
bound = compile_schema(fleet, d_model=256)
# 50 vehicles × (4×4 coarse + 4 internal fields) = manageable
# dispatch ↔ vehicles[i] (coarse) ↔ vehicles[i].camera, etc.
# vehicles[0] does NOT directly attend to vehicles[1].camera
```

Without coarse-graining, 50 vehicles with dense cross-attention is 50² × fields² connections. With coarse-graining, each vehicle interacts through its 4×4 summary — O(50 × 16) instead of O(50² × 100+).

### Hierarchical composition for world models

Deep nesting creates a chain of coarse-grained fields at each level:

```python
@dataclass
class MacroEconomy:
    __coarse__ = Field(2, 4)
    gdp: Field = Field(1, 2)
    inflation: Field = Field(1, 2)
    employment: Field = Field(1, 4)
    # ... 50+ fields

@dataclass
class Country:
    __coarse__ = Field(4, 4)
    macro: MacroEconomy = dc_field(default_factory=MacroEconomy)
    politics: Field = Field(2, 8)      # or another nested type
    demographics: Field = Field(1, 4)

@dataclass
class World:
    us: Country = dc_field(default_factory=Country)
    cn: Country = dc_field(default_factory=Country)
    regime: Field = Field(4, 4)

bound = compile_schema(World(), d_model=64)
# regime ↔ us (4×4 coarse) ↔ us.macro (2×4 coarse) ↔ us.macro.gdp
# us (coarse) ↔ cn (coarse) — countries see each other's summaries
# us.macro.gdp does NOT directly attend to cn.macro.inflation
```

The attention path from US GDP to Chinese inflation goes: `us.macro.gdp → us.macro (coarse) → us (coarse) → regime ↔ cn (coarse) → cn.macro (coarse) → cn.macro.inflation`. Each level compresses, so the model learns hierarchical abstractions — not because we told it to, but because the topology forces it.
